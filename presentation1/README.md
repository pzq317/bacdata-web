Slide 2
* The reason why we chose this topic is because it's such a controversial topic and it's influence is world wide.
* The story is about analyzing what's the reason behind the trade war, how the trade war goes and what impact it will bring.

Slide 3
* It's an interesting topic.

Slide 5
* This visualization is important
* It helps people to figure out the deep reasons instead of just knowing the results.
* This topic is not that far from us because each tarrif that imposed in the trade war is affecting our daily life.


Slide 6
* This visualization is useful
* Policies of both countries and the international trade datasets can be hard to understand and interpret, while visualization can give people who are interested in this topic a better way to get information efficiently.

Slide 7
* Flow Map - indicates trade volumes between the U.S. and other regions 
* The map shows commodities export from the Puget Sound region. Each path's width is proportional with the board feed of commodities exported to a particular destination. 

Slide 8
* Sequences Sunburst - indicates trade volumes for each category and each sub-category 
* A good use case is to summarize trade volumes for commodities of each category and each sub-category. The visualization makes it easy to understand the total trade volumes and compared it to trade volumes of sub-category. 
* Where a funnel lets you understand a single pre-selected category and also allows you to see all possible paths. 

Slide 9
* This is an existing chart of imports value around the world. 
* This chart indicates the total value of imports for countries with over $20 billion in imports. 
* The size of the country and the color corresponds to the amount of its imports. 

* How can we improve on this chart: improve the space, we can create a map for every country and use color correspond to the value of its imports. 

Slide 10
* This chart indicates the top 18 imports and exports around the world and the countries that move them the most.
* This chart uses color and icons to show information, which are two useful elements for the chart. However, this chart is too packed for all information. 
* We can improve this by using proportional width to show the import and export values. 

Slide 11
* This chart indicates grains and oilseeds trade by value in billion dollars from 2010 to 2015. 
* This chart is simple and easy to understand. However, we can make it more interactive by using multiple filters. For example, a slider of years, different color for different commodities, etc.
